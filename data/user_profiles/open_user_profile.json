            "brand_preferences": "This shopper is pragmatic about brands: they notice reputation and guarantees but do not exhibit blind brand loyalty. They treat a recognized name or warranty as a positive signal of reliability, yet will switch to lesser-known options if those offer equal or better value or functionality. Brand status matters when it signals consistent quality or better after-sales support, but it is not the sole deciding factor.",
            "price_sensitivity": "Price matters and is regularly weighed against perceived value. The user frequently calculates unit cost, calls out perceived overpricing, and will downgrade satisfaction when price does not match benefit. At the same time they will pay a premium for items that clearly deliver superior utility, durability, or enjoyment, so their sensitivity is conditional rather than absolute.",
            "review_sensitivity": "They rely on detailed, experience-driven information rather than headline scores alone. Ratings and reviews are used as practical probes: the user reads for real-world behavior, common failure modes, and setup or usability notes, and they incorporate other people's experiences into their own decision calculus. They both consult reviews before buying and contribute thorough reviews after using products, indicating an evidence-oriented approach to social proof.",
            "functional_requirements": "Decisions are driven first by whether a product performs the core job reliably and as advertised. The user expects clear, accurate claims and has low tolerance for misleading language or design choices that impede basic use. They accept trade-offs when the main function is strong (e.g., minor cosmetic or convenience issues) but will reject items with critical functional flaws; they also value warranties, documentation, and features that make usage and maintenance easier.",
            "aesthetic_preferences": "Visual appeal and finish matter but are secondary to usefulness. The shopper appreciates attractive, well-made design and will favor items that look and feel pleasant, but aesthetic choices are balanced against practicality \u2014 a nice look will not compensate for fit, durability, or annoyance in everyday use. They notice presentation and packaging, and design that enhances organization or handling earns extra credit.",
            "purchase_preferences": "They prefer transparent, reliable shopping experiences: clear descriptions, helpful documentation, responsive support, and reasonable return or replacement options. Fast delivery is appreciated but not emphasized; instead they prize seller reliability, accurate listings, and warranties that reduce perceived risk. Packaging and ease of installation matter insofar as they affect first-use experience, and the buyer values merchants who make post-purchase resolution straightforward."
