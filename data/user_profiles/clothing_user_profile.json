            "brand_preferences": "The user shows clear loyalty to performance-focused running brands, especially New Balance: multiple purchases and comments like \"I own a lot of New Balance\" and \"never disappointed\" indicate strong repeat preference and trust in that brand's fit and consistency. They also buy broadly across specialty running brands (Topo Athletic, Brooks, Salomon, ASICS, Reebok, Fila), indicating openness to trying other reputable makers when the product matches trail-running needs. When a brand consistently delivers expected fit, comfort and durability (New Balance, Topo Athletic), the user returns to it; when sizing or fit is off (as with one New Balance/other pair that ran small) they note it but still remain generally brand-loyal to those that perform reliably.",
            "price_sensitivity": "The user's behavior indicates medium price sensitivity: they are willing to pay mid-range prices for shoes that deliver fit, comfort and technical features (one purchase at $89.99 was described as \"so worth the money\"), but they mostly buy from mainstream, value-oriented performance brands rather than premium luxury lines. They prioritize value for money \u2014 paying more when the shoe offers clear benefits (durability, traction, cushioning) but do not seek out the cheapest possible options or bargain-only purchases.",
            "rating_sensitivity": "The user demonstrates moderate review sensitivity: they pay attention to product descriptions, ratings and the reputation of established brands, but their own purchase and rating patterns show they rely heavily on personal fit and past brand experience. They will buy items with average ratings in the 3.5\u20134.5 range if the features and brand history match their needs, and they leave positive reviews when satisfied. Ratings inform decisions but do not override fit, comfort or known brand consistency.",
            "functional_requirements": "For trail running shoes the user consistently requires reliable traction and outsole durability (multidirectional lugs, Vibram or similar compounds), protective features (rock plate or toe protection, protective overlays), secure heel and midfoot fit (split-mesh or heel security), adequate cushioning balanced with ground feel (low to moderate drop, cushioning that still allows natural motion), and weather/terrain resistance (mud/snow release design, water-repellent coatings or drainage). They also expect breathability, a comfortable collar/padding, and a fit that does not cause toe crowding or difficulty putting the shoe on.",
            "aesthetic_preferences": "The user prefers practical, sporty designs with visible functional details rather than fashion-only sneakers. They appreciate attractive, noticeable colors (comments like \"love the color\" and \"color is outstanding\"), often choosing shoes with color accents (purple, bold tones) while still favoring classic trail silhouettes. Overall they favor utilitarian styling that also offers some personality through color rather than minimalist or purely fashion-forward looks.",
            "purchase_preferences": "The user values fast, reliable shipping and accurate product descriptions (they praised \"shipping was quite fast\" and that shoes matched descriptions). They prefer trustworthy sellers and established brand listings (Amazon/brand stores) and expect consistent sizing information \u2014 they will return items when sizing is wrong but may tolerate minor fit issues if the shoe is useful. Clear return policies, easy exchanges for correct sizes, and sellers that deliver on advertised features are important to their shopping satisfaction."

Overall they favor established denim labels with consistent sizing and quality rather than unknown or fast\u2011fashion brands.",
            "price_sensitivity": "The user demonstrates medium price sensitivity: they are value\u2011conscious and actively compare prices, but will pay more when the product delivers perceived quality. Examples include celebrating purchases at $21.99 and $28.99 as \u201cjackpot\u201d finds, calling out when a comparable Levi Signature pair at nearly half the price beat a more expensive option, and still buying Jag items priced higher when fit and fabric justify it. They seek bargains but are willing to spend more for proper fit, real denim feel, and durability.",
            "rating_sensitivity": "The user displays medium review sensitivity: they read and reference other customers\u2019 comments (e.g., seam issues mentioned by others) and use ratings as one factor, but they rely heavily on their own fit tests and personal experience. High personal ratings (mostly 4\u20135 stars) indicate they will buy well\u2011rated items, yet they still try mid\u2011rated items if descriptions and features match their needs. They also trust seller policies and service reports in purchase decisions (mentions of Amazon customer service and free returns influenced continued buying).",
            "functional_requirements": "For jeans and similar bottoms the user requires a straight or slightly relaxed leg (not skinny or flared), a mid\u2011 to just\u2011below\u2011waist rise to minimize muffin top, enough real\u2011denim cotton content with a small amount of stretch (examples seen: ~98% cotton/2% spandex or blends with 1\u20132% elastane) and strong recovery so the garment keeps shape. They expect true denim appearance (not overly elastic \u201cfake\u201d jeans), comfortable waistband (no digging), options for pull\u2011on or zip\u2011fly depending on fit, and machine\u2011washable fabrics that hold up to cold wash/hang dry. Inseam/length consistency (around 31",
            "aesthetic_preferences": "The user prefers classic, understated denim styling: straight or modern straight cuts, neutral and versatile washes (indigo, gray, classic blue, lighter seasonal weights), minimal embellishment, and authentic denim texture rather than shiny or overly stretchy looks. They avoid skinny ankles and flares, favor a length that works with flats and low heels, and like subtle pocket details (small signature embroidery) rather than flashy hardware or heavy distressing. Color choices skew neutral and wearable across seasons.",
            "purchase_preferences": "The user values reliable sizing information, generous return policies, and responsive customer service: they returned defective items and praised free replacements and free shipping. Accurate size listings and consistent fit across purchases are important; inconsistent sizing (e.g., same brand varying by 3 sizes) is a purchase deterrent. They prefer sellers with easy returns, clear product details (fabric content, rise, inseam), and quick resolution from customer service. Delivery speed and special packaging were not emphasized; functional, trustworthy order fulfillment and post\u2011sale support are the priority."
